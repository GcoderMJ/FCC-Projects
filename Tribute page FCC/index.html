      <p> In 1961 to 1963, as one of the software programmers at the SAGE Project at Lincoln Lab, Margaret who wrote software for the first AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), which searched for "unfriendly" aircrafts.</p>

      <p> Hamilton was assigned to a program which nobody was able to ever figure out or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to me as well. And what had happened was it was tricky programming, and the person who wrote it took delight in the fact that all of his comments were in Greek and Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually got it to work. It even printed out its answers in Latin and Greek. I was the first one to get it to work</p>

      <p>Hamilton's priority alarm displays in the on-board flight software were immensly valuable during one of the critical moments of the Apollo 11 mission. The Apollo Guidance Computer together with the on-board flight software averted an abort of the landing on the Moon. Hamilton's priority alarm displays warned the astronauts that there was an emergencywhere the astronauts could decide whether to land or not.‚Äù</p>
